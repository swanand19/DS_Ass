1. What is difference between logical clock and physical clock? 
-> a. Physical Clocks : 
      Physical clocks are based on real-time hardware mechanisms such as oscillators or quartz crystals. They provide an accurate representation of real-world time
      and are synchronized with the global time reference. eg. wrist watches, etc.
   b. Logical Clocks : 
      Logical clocks are not bound to physical time but rather aim to provide a relative ordering of events within a distributed system. eg. Lamport clocks, vector 
      clocks, etc.
2. Why is it necessary to synchronize the clocks in distributed real time system? 
-> a. Event Ordering: Synchronized clocks ensure that events occurring across different nodes or components of the system are correctly ordered. Without synchronized
      clocks, it becomes challenging to determine the causal relationships between events accurately.
   b. Consistency and Replication: In replicated systems, synchronized clocks are essential for maintaining consistency among replicas. Synchronized clocks ensure that 
      updates and changes are applied in the correct order across all replicas, preventing divergence and inconsistency.
   c. Security and Authentication: Synchronized clocks are crucial for security protocols such as authentication and authorization. They help in enforcing time-based 
      access controls, preventing replay attacks, and ensuring the integrity of cryptographic operations.
3. How the principle of Berkeley algorithm is used to synchronize time in distributed system?
-> The Berkeley algorithm synchronizes time in distributed systems by having a coordinator collect time readings from all nodes, calculate the average time, determine 
    the time difference between each node's clock and the average, and then broadcast these differences for each node to adjust its clock accordingly. This iterative 
    process minimizes time deviation among all nodes.
